    <p>So you want to lose weight and get in shape,
      but you don’t want to leave your house?</p>
      <p style="font-weight:bold;">You want to know:</p>
      <p style="font-weight:bold;">Can you build muscle mass with bodyweight exercises?</p>
      <p>Yes, bodyweight exercises can build muscle mass, as long as continuously challenge your muscles by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increasing reps.</li>
        <li>Decreasing your rest periods.</li>
        <li>Performing more difficult variations.</li>
        <li>Increasing your time under tension (by going slower).</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight:bold;">In a circuit routine,
         you’ll do each exercise in succession without a break in between (if you’re able).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once you’ve finished all exercises in the circuit, do it again.</li>
        <li>If you’re still able after the 2nd run through, go for a third.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because all of these exercises come one after another, you’re bound to get tired – and that’s okay!
        It’s better to stop and take a break than to do an <span style="text-transform:uppercase; color: #e84545;">exercise incorrectly.</span></p>
        <p>At First You Can just do it at your own pace, slowly increasing the reps and decreasing rest until you can do as per image.
        </p><p style="font-weight:bold;">After you’ve completed your workout at home, feel free to cool down and stretch.</span> </p>
        <p>Do this routine 2-3 times a week, but never on consecutive days.
          You don’t build muscle when you’re exercising, you build muscle when you’re resting,
          so try not to do a strength training routine (of the same muscle groups) two days in a row.</p>
